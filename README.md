## Design Process

### 1. Concept Selection

Compared 2-wheel, 3-wheel and 4-wheel configurations.

| Config. | Advantage | Drawback |
|---|---|---|
| 2W | Light, simple | Lower stability |
| 3W | More stable | Extra drag |
| 4W | High stability | Heavy and complex |

**Selected: 2-wheel configuration**

### 2. Physics-Based Design

Key parameters:

$$
R = \text{wheel radius}, \quad
L = \text{chassis length}, \quad
H = \text{chassis height}
$$

Obstacle-clearance constraint:

$$
H_{\min} = f(R,L)
$$

---

### 3. MATLAB Simulation

MATLAB was used to simulate obstacle crossing and evaluate:

$$
(x,y,\theta), \quad C_{\min}
$$

where $C_{\min}$ is the minimum chassis clearance.

---

### 4. Parameter Selection

Design constraints:

$$
H_1 = f(R)
$$

$$
H_2 = g(R)
$$

The intersection / feasible region was used to select the final design parameters:

$$
R^*, \quad L^*, \quad H^*
$$

### 5. Prototype & Testing

**Physics → Simulation → Design → Prototype → Testing**

The physical prototype was tested and refined based on experimental results.
